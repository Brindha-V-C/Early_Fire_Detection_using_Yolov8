## 📌 Project Overview

This project integrates hardware and cloud technologies to detect fire incidents with high accuracy and minimal latency. It uses:

- **ESP32** for sensor data acquisition (temperature, humidity, gas)
- **ESP32-CAM** for capturing images when anomalies are detected
- **YOLOv8** on **Google Cloud Run** to analyze images for fire presence
- **Twilio API** to send real-time SMS alerts including sensor values, location, and image links
- **Google Maps Link API** to share GPS coordinates with responders

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Configuration
- Connect the following components to the **ESP32**:
  - **DHT11** for temperature and humidity
  - **MQ2** Gas Sensor for smoke/gas detection
  - **GPS Module (e.g., u-blox NEO-6M)** for location data
- Connect **ESP32-CAM** to ESP32 using UART or GPIO pins for triggering
- Ensure stable **5V power supply** to both ESP32 and ESP32-CAM

### 2. ESP32 Programming
- Flash the ESP32 with Arduino code to:
  - Read sensor values
  - Detect anomalies in gas, temperature, or humidity
  - Send data to Google Cloud endpoint (HTTP POST)
  - Trigger ESP32-CAM if fire-like conditions are detected

### 3. ESP32-CAM Programming
- ESP32-CAM captures image upon trigger
- Uploads image to **Google Cloud Storage** via HTTP POST or signed URL
- You can use ESP32-CAM libraries (like `ESP32HTTPClient` and `WiFiClient`) for HTTP requests

### 4. Google Cloud Setup
- Create a Flask-based API and deploy it on **Google Cloud Run**
- Setup endpoints:
  - `/upload-data`: Accepts sensor data and image metadata
  - YOLOv8 integration endpoint for fire detection
- Use Google Cloud Storage bucket to receive and host uploaded images
- Use **Ultralytics YOLOv8** pretrained or fine-tuned model to detect fire in images

### 5. Twilio Configuration
- Register on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
- Get your **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and **Phone Number**
- Integrate Twilio in your Flask app using `twilio` Python package
- Format alert SMS with:
  - Sensor readings
  - Location via Google Maps link
  - Fire image URL
